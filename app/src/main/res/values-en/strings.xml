        Last updated on: September 3, 2020\n
\u3000\u3000Dear Users:\n
\u3000\u3000Thank you for choosing Pureon Wallet. The Pureon Wallet Service Terms (hereinafter referred to as the “Terms” or “Agreements”) is entered into by Pureon (hereinafter referred to as “Pureon” or “we”) and the user (hereinafter referred to as “you” or “user”). This agreement shall be legally binding between you and Pureon.\n

        \u3000\u3000Pureon is here to remind you that since the code used by Pureon was open-sourced on Github.com, it is possible for anyone to use the open source Pureon code, or self-modified code, to package the resulting software. The third party privately packaged software is not the Pureon application, is exempt from this protocol and Pureon assumes no responsibility. This Term applies only to use Pureon\'s official package for installation, and User should prudently obtain Pureon\'s official authorization for the Pureon Wallet application.\n\n
        I. confirmation and acceptance of this terms.\n
        \u3000\u30001. You fully understand that this Term and related protocols apply only to the Pureon Wallet application itself, and do not apply to any other third-party application that the Pureon Wallet links to, or any applications developed or owned by Pureon.\n
        \u3000\u30002. When you download the Pureon Wallet software and create or import the wallet, it shall be deemed that you have fully read and accepted all terms of this agreement, and the terms shall take effect immediately and shall be binding on both parties.\n
\u3000\u30003. This Agreement may be updated by Pureon at any time. Once the modified agreement is published on Pureon Wallet, it will take effect automatically without further notice. After Pureon publishes the modified protocol, if you do not accept the modified Terms, please immediately stop using Pureon Wallet, and your continued usage of Pureon Wallet will be deemed to accept the modified Terms.\n
        \u3000\u30004. If you are under 18 years of age, or have no or limited capacity for civil conduct, use the Pureon Wallet under the guidance of your parents or legal guardians.\n
        II. Definitions\n
        \u3000\u30001. Pureon: the wallet client developed by the Pureon based on the Nervos network and Ethereum network to provide users with access to the Nervos network and Ethereum network, as well as services for storing the Nervos network and Ethereum network crypto-tokens and crypto-assets, including other ancillary tools developed to facilitate users\' use of related systems.\n
        \u3000\u30002. User:\n
        (1) the user must be a natural person with full capacity for civil conduct;\n
        (2) if you use the Pureon Wallet service under the age of 18, you should use it under the guidance of your parents or legal guardian. Where a person without capacity for civil conduct or with restricted capacity for civil USES the Pureon Wallet beyond the scope of his or her civil rights or capacity, for all consequences arising therefrom, the Pureon Wallet shall have the right to hold you and your parents or legal guardian responsible.\n
\u3000\u30003. Creating or importing a wallet: the process by which you confirm the performance of this agreement and create or import a wallet using Pureon Wallet.\n
        \u3000\u30004. Wallet password: when you create a Pureon Wallet wallet, the software interface will prompts you to fill in the password to encrypt and protect the private key. As a decentralized application, the wallet password is not stored on your mobile device nor Pureon server. Once lost, you must have the plaintext private key or mnemonic to reset a new password.\n
        \u3000\u30005. Information prompt: information prompt content involved in the Pureon Wallet software operation interface is recommended for users to follow relevant steps.\n
        \u3000\u30006. Specific user: refers to the user who must cooperate with Pureon to fulfill the personal information disclosure obligation in accordance with local laws, regulations and policies.\n
        \u3000\u30007. Private key: composed of private random characters, is the core element of crypto-tokens owned and used by users.\n
        \u3000\u30008. Public key: the private key is generated through one-way derivation based on cryptography principle and used to generate the blockchain wallet address. The wallet address is the public collection address. \n
        \u3000\u30009. Mnemonic words: a number of ordered English words generated by a random algorithm. Mnemonic words are easy way to record private key, convenient for users to backup and keep.\n
        \u3000\u300010. Keystore: is a file where the private key or mnemonic word is encrypted and saved through the wallet password set by the user. It is stored only on your mobile device and will not be synchronized to Pureon server.\n
        \u3000\u300011. Crypto-tokens: refer to the currently supported crypto-tokens for Pureon Wallet, including but not limited to CKC, ETH, Ethereum ERC20 standard tokens, ERC721 standard tokens, etc.\n
        \u3000\u300012. Personal information refers to records in electronic or any other way to separate or combined with other information to identify the user personal identity of all kinds of information, including but not limited to natural person\'s name, date of birth, id number, personal biometric information, address, telephone number, bank card number, E-mail address, wallet, mobile devices, information, operation records, trading records, etc., but does not include a user\'s password wallet, private keys, the mnemonic word, Keystore.\n
        III. Service contents\n
        \u3000\u30001. Create or import a wallet. For Pureon Wallet enabled crypto-tokens, you can use Pureon Wallet to generate new wallets or import compatible wallets of the relevant blockchain system generated by other wallet tools.\n
        \u3000\u30002. Transfer and receive crypto-token. You can use the Pureon Wallet transfer and collect crypto-tokens. Transfer refers to that the payer uses the recipient\'s blockchain address to transfer the crypto-tokens. Actual transfer and collection behaviors all occur in the relevant blockchain system (not in Pureon Wallet).\n
        \u3000\u30003. Manage crypto-token. You can use Pureon Wallet to add, store, and remove crypto-tokens supported by Pureon Wallet.\n
        \u3000\u30004. Browse DApp. Users can jump to and use the service provided by the DApp (including Pureon\'s own DApp and third-party DApp) via a link on the Pureon Wallet.\n
        \u3000\u30005. Service suspension. You know that based on the "irrevocable" property of the blockchain system, we cannot suspend or revoke transfer transactions for you, but in emergencies such as administrative orders, we can suspend or restrict a user\'s accession to the Pureon Wallet software.\n
        \u3000\u30006. Other services deemed necessary by Pureon.\n
        Users should know the following frequently asked questions when accepting the services provided by Pureon:\n
        1. According to the decentralization property of blockchain system and in order to protect the security of users\' crypto-tokens, Pureon provides decentralized services, which is fundamentally different from the centralized financial services provided by banking financial institutions. Users understand that Pureon does not provide the following services:\n
       (1) market price view;\n
(2) store the user\'s wallet password (i.e. the password set by the user when creating/importing the wallet), private key, mnemonic word and Keystore;\n
(3) retrieve the user\'s wallet password, private key, mnemonic word and Keystore;\n
(4) freeze wallet;\n
(5) report the loss of the wallet;\n
(6) restore the wallet;\n
(7) transaction rollback;\n
(8) transaction records (users\' successful transaction records will be recorded on the blockchain system ledger, and Pureon Wallet itself does not provide historical transaction data access services).\n
2. Since Pureon does not provide the above services, users should keep the mobile device containing the Pureon Wallet and its key chip and hardware, the Pureon Wallet backup, the backup wallet password, mnemonics, the private key, and the Keystore on their own.
